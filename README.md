# Here's Liribot! She accepts the following arguments post- node liri.js:
"concert-list" + "a band you want to see is touring"
"spotify-this-song" + "the title of a track you want to know more about"
"movie-this" + "title of a movie you want to know more about"
"do-what-it-says" + leave this one blank. Just do what it says.

# Known bugs
do-what-it-says currently is throwing errors that I still need to figure out
Update: It's working now!

# Nice-To-Haves
*I want to make the input an inqurier prompt for nicer usability and recursion.
